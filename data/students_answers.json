    "technological evolution is a nonstop and real fact and it will improve our way to study. we are finding new ways of improving systems and devices everyday and history has shown us that trying to keep that from happening only leads to conflict and, eventually, violence between us. the only option to guarantee that the influence of this development in our children's education, in a future, will be positive and productive, is to accept that fact and try to adapt ourselves. therefore, we can start working together and stablish common rules and regulations on how these new tools should be used and theach the new generations their benefits and their risks so they can be selfconcious of the kind of resources they are working with and be able to do it properly. once that happens students all over the world will be selfefficientto work with all kind of information and technologies, which means we should guarantee its access for everyone. a posterior debate about mesaures to make these resources fairly spread around the globe should be taken and collaboration between governts will be imperative to make that happen.otherwise we must have care with this evolution beacuse it can create a technological crisis. and at the same time, not all the world would be able to adquire technological services and that is  not fair at all, it would create big inequalities. that's why technology has both good and bad aspects, but if we manage to solve the bad one's, then ther shouldabe not proble",
    "positive aspects: 1in the future, with artificial intelligence (ai), each student can have a personalized study plan according to their capacities2the internet has helped bring more access to information than ever before, this definitely helps students and the education sector in general.3technological evolution will change the way that the teachers teach, converting the classes more interestingnegative: 1 students are of all ages, but it is mostly minors. there should be a limit on how much data is recollected on minors, since it risks their privacy and security.2make students spend a lot of time in front of a screen, straining their eyesight and getting hooked to certain apps and as a consequence, losing track of time and lack of sleep.3so much automatization in education could affect the relationship between teachers and students, and could make students feel like just a number.4 the impact on private life has had though is pretty huge, basically because almost all persona information is used to upgrade the technology, i feel that, although it is important to keep upgrading technology, sometimes the invasion of private life is a bit too much",
    "positive:it could improve getting on the schedule when you cannot attend a classhelp students adapt to the tecnologies in the workplacemake the work easier as everything would be accessible from the webnegative:students may use these same tools to cheatmake students spend a lot of time in front of a screenmake students more inactive",
    "positives: better understanding of the world that surrounds us, leading to a more truthful; education. more connection possibilities, for example for people that can not go to school due to medical conditions, or people that live far away from any school. it can make studying more fun for the students leading that to have more enthusiasm to go to school. the way we study will completely change as technology will provide us different ways to have information and access it.negatives if we start using computers more often, we may lose facetoface contact children will be more dependant on technologies, being unable to rely on themselves without the help of a device technological inequalities can take place as not everyone will have access to all the technology. it can make them rely too much on technology which can lead to them rather than asking their teachers or peers.",
    "positive aspects are, first of all, the way everything will improve to help students have more and better oportunities to learn. through technology we can facilitate education in every circumstance where a kid can't attend school. also the way we study will completelly change as technology will provide us diferent ways to have information and access it (for example in the future there will be less memorizing but bitter understandment of concepts and ways to apply our knowledge).as for negatives things, technology can be dangerous. one thing that could happen is that not everybody will have the same access to technology and so inecualities can take place in more situacions. also technology can overtake other sectors so many people won't be able to study other things not related to technology.",
    "positive:we strongly believe that technology can greatly improve education with its evolution because it has already improved drastically over the last two decades where we've seen the digitalization and automatization of any tech already established in society. some clear examples of this impact are textbooks, studying tools, and information access. moreover, technological evolution can be useful to personalize and adapt the content to the needs of any child. in this way, each child could study at their own pace and would have better knowledge. negative:although the impact is mainly positive, a few arguments back up some negative aspects of it. one to consider would be the limitation of humanhuman communication, an aspect that is needed in the education process to work around disagreements and other conflicts, this communication can be obstructed by new technologies taking progress backward.one downside of the implementation of digital education is the lack of the facetoface communication that can certainly be beneficial to the development in the first stages of life.",
    "i stronly believe that technology can greatly improve education with its evolucion due to the simple fact that it already has improved drastically over the last 20 years where we've seen the digitalization and atomatization of any tech that was already stablished in society. some clear examples of this impact are textbooks, studing tools and information acces. although the impact is mainly positive, there are a few arguments that back up some negative aspects of it. one to really consider would be the limitation of humanhuman communcation, an aspect that that is needed in the education process to work arround disagreements and other conflicts, this communication can be obstructed by new technologies really taking progress backwards.",
    "positive aspects: technological evolution can improve education by giving opportunities to people with no resources and to the general public, because anyone can access the internet and everybody is able to learn in many different ways (which was not as accessible as now before the \"internet revolution\"). interactive contents have the potential to be more illustrative than traditional supports. for example, seeing an animation on a video or watching something in vr can be easier to understand than through images, text or explanations on a blackboard. as highquality electronic devices start to become accessible for more people, there's more people that can help spread knowledge. you don't need to have your own book editorial to start making interactive educational apps or divulgative videos covering almost any topic.negative aspects: the increasing use of technologies would promote less human contact and this would turn people into  as anyone can do pretty much anything on the internet, misinformation and the loss of quality knowledge spreading may be a consequence (which is already happening in platforms such as tiktok)  some oral skills would be lost with the technological evolution, since people tend to focus more in technological devices than the people that is around them.",
    "i think technological evolution can improve education by giving opportunities to people with no resources, people could access internet and be able to learn in many different ways.also, it could change the educational model by making it more interactive and productive, since the actual educational model is old and in some cases, makes people lose interest in education.but, in the other hand, technological evolution can harm education if all of our materials are online, this can create a dependence for technology at a very young age and could be very perjudicial.in addition, some oral skills would be lost with the technological evolution, since people tend to focus more in technological devices than the people that is around them.",
    "education is the key for future progress. technology is a good way to improve education. but it will have negative and positive impacts on education.on the one hand, technology has made available many resources that can be used in schools (laptops, internet, electronic books...) to enhance our learning experience. furthermore, implementing technology in education can mean that everyone in the world with a stable internet connection can access classes and studies regardless their geographical location and the infrastructure in said place. hence, online education could provide children the chance to learn regardless of where they live and whether they have a school nearby.lastly, the uses of technology to evaluate how children are learning can help teachers and professionals improve their teaching methods.on the other hand, access to technology is a key fact in this discussion. people with lower economic income will have a great disadvantage in their access to technology and that will cause a very negative impact in society. then, technology development does not guarantee anything. we need to change the whole system in order to get all the benefits possibles from it. lastly, another negative aspect is the lost with human contact. if education becomes automated, children will"

    "openness and resource sharing are very related. in this second case, those requirements are the ones that are more present, since ngos want to share resources and make their database information available to other ngos so that they can join efforts. considering its goal of sharing data, we can see that all the requirements stated before are satisfied: openness: openness of a computer system is the characteristic that determines whether the system can be extended and reimplemented in various ways. the openness of distributed systems is achieved by specifying the key software interface of the system and making it available to software developers so that the system can be extended in many ways. > have a software application that would enable them to easily have access to other ngo data and also offer a collaborative planning tool\u009D resource sharing: resources, i.e., hardware, software and data, from different parts of the system are shared by multiple users > to join efforts so that they can share the data they collect continuously about the places that need their help and coordinate their actions to offer better overall services fault tolerance: operations that continue even in the presence of faults are referred to as faulttolerant. distributed systems achieve faulttolerance by means of replication > they are worried about the problems that may emerge in the use of the tool if the network fails. in a first cycle only a couple of ngos will pilot this collaboration mediated by the desired application. but, in the future, it is expected that more ngos will join the effort\u009D heterogeneity: variety an difference on platforms > each ngo has its own database and a planning tool adapted to its needs. the technologies used by these databases and tools are diverse",

    "the main nonfunctional requirement in this case is resource sharing, as now multiple ngos had decided to work together and, in order to do it, they need to share the same software for planning purposes. this is stated in the text in the following lines: \"now they have decided to join efforts so that they can share the data they collect continuously about the places that need their help and coordinate their actions to offer better overall services\".also concurrency is required, as multiple users from different ngos may need to access the application at the same time. part of the text: \" they would like to have a software application that would enable them to easily have access to other ngo data and also offer a collaborative planning tool\".scalability and openness are also required. scalability, because a higher amount of resources may be needed, depending on the emergency. openness, in order to extend and implement the same system in different ways. \"given the importance of their actions, they are worried about the problems that may emerge in the use of the tool if the network fails\".\" another problem is that each ngo has its own database and a planning tool adapted to its needs."
