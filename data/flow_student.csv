We are finding new ways of improving systems and devices everyday and history has shown us that trying to keep that from happening only leads to conflict and, eventually, violence between us. The only option to guarantee that the influence of this development in our children's education, in a future, will be positive and productive, is to accept that fact and try to adapt ourselves. 
Therefore, we can start working together and stablish common rules and regulations on how these new tools should be used and theach the new generations their benefits and their risks so they can be self-concious of the kind of resources they are working with and be able to do it properly. Once that happens students all over the world will be self-efficient
to work with all kind of information and technologies, which means we should guarantee its access for everyone.                        
A posterior debate about mesaures to make these resources fairly spread around the globe should be taken and collaboration between governts will be imperative to make that happen.

Otherwise we must have care with this evolution beacuse it can create a technological crisis. And at the same time, not all the world would be able to adquire technological services and that is  not fair at all, it would create big inequalities.

Negative: 

1- Students are of all ages, but it is mostly minors. There should be a limit on how much data is recollected on minors, since it risks their privacy and security.
2-Make students spend a lot of time in front of a screen, straining their eyesight and getting hooked to certain apps and as a consequence, losing track of time and lack of sleep.

We strongly believe that technology can greatly improve education with its evolution because it has already improved drastically over the last two decades where we've seen the digitalization and automatization of any tech already established in society. Some clear examples of this impact are textbooks, studying tools, and information access. 

Moreover, technological evolution can be useful to personalize and adapt the content to the needs of any child. In this way, each child could study at their own pace and would have better knowledge. 

Negative:
Although the impact is mainly positive, a few arguments back up some negative aspects of it. One to consider would be the limitation of human-human communication, an aspect that is needed in the education process to work around disagreements and other conflicts, this communication can be obstructed by new technologies taking progress backward.

- As high-quality electronic devices start to become accessible for more people, there's more people that can help spread knowledge. You don't need to have your own book editorial to start making interactive educational apps or divulgative videos covering almost any topic.

Negative Aspects:

1. Although Technological developments have improved means of learning they also can be a strong distraction for some students , while in class and at home , students can simply waste there time of social media platforms and end up cutting there study time in half becoming completely unproductive.
2. Students already use electronic devices for entertainment purposes a lot on  a daily basis. Adding several more hours of screen time at class or studying at home, may harm and cause damage to the body. prolongated hours on the screen have proven to cause eye dryness , headache or migraine, disruption of sleep and all sort of health problems

+ no physical constrains (online classes)

- there is a risk of isolation of the students (only focus on digital tools) and refuse collaboration 
- important skills may be taken for granted and even forgotten (handwriting / propper orthography and grammar usage (since most apps already provide automatic corrections)
- need of balance between a useful tool and a requirement","0","0","1678382654"

-More individualised tasks/course plans are possible by using digital solutions
-Digital Solutions could allow children to repeat information (videos of lectures,..)
-Digital Solution could support the explanation of abstract concepts and make them more accessible 

Negative aspects:
- Focusing to much on digital solutions would create a distance between people
-Working together with other people not only with your digital device could become difficult
-People tend to create tools for the ""average"" user and unique strengths/weaknesses are not considered to the level they should be","0","0","1678382630"
"2054","411","0","1888","0","1","Positive : 
- create new more engaging, immersive ways to learn (gamification, using interactive tools) 
- offer a possibility to practice some skills in virtual world before going to real life -- advanced training options (ex. for medcine students) 
- access to almost unlimited amount of content that can nurture the study process

Negative:
- if development of tech tools is not well managed, there will be a risk of violation of privacy etc 
- if technological tools are made as the only option in a given context, it can make education more exclusive and not accessible for everyone
- tech tools offer lots of shortcuts in the learning process, people may feel less motivated to put in extra effort which would negatively effect their individual learning results","0","0","1678382548"
"2055","411","0","1890","0","1","Pros:
- Technological advancements and applications for education can allow for more flexibility and personalization which could foster learning for students.
- Disabilities and other isolating factors can be addressed through technologies, as different technologies can be used to make communication in the learning process as well as learning easier for students who need it (clickers, other forms of question/answer apps, etc.)
- The use of technology allows to develop new forms of education and assessment that couldn't have been thought of before, as well as education allowing engineers to develop technology further.

Cons:
- Economic difference has to be managed or addressed prior to applying the learning technologies in order to guarantee access for learners and educators.
- If the educators and learner themselves lack the digital literacy necessary for the technologies applied, they might not be as effective.
- As privatization of technology and technological implementations is furthered, data and other safety factors might be compromised whenever technological applications are used.","0","0","1678382566"
